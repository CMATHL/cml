## Math

CML provides a large number of mathematical functions for general purposes. You can see more about this in the following [file](./MATH.md).

## Easing Functions

The easing functions are an implementation of the functions presented in [easings.net](http://easings.net/), useful particularly for animations. Easing is a method of distorting time to control apparent motion in animation. It is most commonly used for slow-in, slow-out. By easing time, animated transitions are smoother and exhibit more plausible motion.

Easing functions take a value inside the range `[0.0, 1.0]` and usually will return a value inside that same range. However, in some of the easing functions, the returned value extrapolate that range (Check the [easings.net](http://easings.net/) to see those functions).
