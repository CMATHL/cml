Representation of floating point numbers
========================================

The IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic defines binary
formats for single and double precision numbers.  Each number is composed
of three parts: a *sign bit* (:math:`s`), an *exponent*
(:math:`E`) and a *fraction* (:math:`f`).  The numerical value of the
combination :math:`(s,E,f)` is given by the following formula,

.. only:: not texinfo

   .. math:: (-1)^s (1 \cdot fffff\dots) 2^E

.. only:: texinfo

   ::

      (-1)^s (1.fffff...) 2^E

.. index::
   single: normalized form, IEEE format
   single: denormalized form, IEEE format

The sign bit is either zero or one.  The exponent ranges from a minimum value
:math:`E_{min}`
to a maximum value
:math:`E_{max}`
depending on the precision.  The exponent is converted to an
unsigned number
:math:`e`, known as the *biased exponent*, for storage by adding a
*bias* parameter,

.. only:: not texinfo

   .. math:: e = E + \hbox{\it bias}

.. only:: texinfo

   ::

      e = E + bias

The sequence :math:`fffff...` represents the digits of the binary
fraction :math:`f`.  The binary digits are stored in *normalized
form*, by adjusting the exponent to give a leading digit of :math:`1`.
Since the leading digit is always 1 for normalized numbers it is
assumed implicitly and does not have to be stored.
Numbers smaller than
:math:`2^{E_{min}}`
are be stored in *denormalized form* with a leading zero,

.. only:: not texinfo

   .. math:: (-1)^s (0 \cdot fffff\dots) 2^{E_{min}}

.. only:: texinfo

   ::

      (-1)^s (0.fffff...) 2^(E_min)

.. index::
   single: zero, IEEE format
   single: infinity, IEEE format

This allows gradual underflow down to
:math:`2^{E_{min} - p}`
for :math:`p` bits of precision.
A zero is encoded with the special exponent of
:math:`2^{E_{min}-1}`
and infinities with the exponent of
:math:`2^{E_{max}+1}`.

.. index::
   single: single precision, IEEE format

The format for single precision numbers uses 32 bits divided in the
following way::

  seeeeeeeefffffffffffffffffffffff

  s = sign bit, 1 bit
  e = exponent, 8 bits  (E_min=-126, E_max=127, bias=127)
  f = fraction, 23 bits

.. index::
   single: double precision, IEEE format

The format for double precision numbers uses 64 bits divided in the
following way::

  seeeeeeeeeeeffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff

  s = sign bit, 1 bit
  e = exponent, 11 bits  (E_min=-1022, E_max=1023, bias=1023)
  f = fraction, 52 bits

It is often useful to be able to investigate the behavior of a
calculation at the bit-level and the library provides functions for
printing the IEEE representations in a human-readable form.

.. float vs double vs long double
.. (how many digits are available for each)

.. function:: void cml_ieee754_fprintf_float (FILE * stream, const float * x)
              void cml_ieee754_fprintf_double (FILE * stream, const double * x)

   These functions output a formatted version of the IEEE floating-point
   number pointed to by :data:`x` to the stream :data:`stream`. A pointer is
   used to pass the number indirectly, to avoid any undesired promotion
   from :code:`float` to :code:`double`.  The output takes one of the
   following forms,

   :code:`NaN`

      the Not-a-Number symbol

   :code:`Inf, -Inf`

      positive or negative infinity

   :code:`1.fffff...*2^E, -1.fffff...*2^E`

      a normalized floating point number

   :code:`0.fffff...*2^E, -0.fffff...*2^E`

      a denormalized floating point number

   :code:`0, -0`

      positive or negative zero

   The output can be used directly in GNU Emacs Calc mode by preceding it
   with :code:`2#` to indicate binary.

.. @item [non-standard IEEE float], [non-standard IEEE double]
.. an unrecognized encoding

.. function:: void cml_ieee754_printf_float (const float * x)
              void cml_ieee754_printf_double (const double * x)

   These functions output a formatted version of the IEEE floating-point
   number pointed to by :data:`x` to the stream :code:`stdout`.

The following program demonstrates the use of the functions by printing
the single and double precision representations of the fraction
:math:`1/3`.  For comparison the representation of the value promoted from
single to double precision is also printed.

.. include:: examples/ieee.c
   :code:

The binary representation of :math:`1/3` is :math:`0.01010101...`.  The
output below shows that the IEEE format normalizes this fraction to give
a leading digit of 1::

   f = 1.01010101010101010101011*2^-2
  fd = 1.0101010101010101010101100000000000000000000000000000*2^-2
   d = 1.0101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101*2^-2

The output also shows that a single-precision number is promoted to
double-precision by adding zeros in the binary representation.
