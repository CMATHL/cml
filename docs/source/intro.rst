Introduction
************

The C Math Library (CML) is a pure mathematical C library with a wide variety of
mathematical functions that seeks to be close to complying with
ANSI C for portability. It's a collection of routines for
numerical computing written from scratch in C. The routines
present a modern API for C programmers, allowing wrappers to be written for very
high level languages. It is free software under the MIT License.

Routines available in CML
=========================

Routines are available for the following areas,

===========================  ===========================  ===========================
Mathematical Functions       Complex Numbers              Special Functions
Quaternions                  Differential Equations       Numerical Differentiation
IEEE Floating-Point          Physical Constants           Easing Functions
Statistics                   Blocks                       Vectors and Matrices
===========================  ===========================  ===========================

Each chapter of this manual
provides detailed definitions of the functions, followed by examples
and references to the articles and other resources on which the 
algorithms are based.
