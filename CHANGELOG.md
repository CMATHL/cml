# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 1.10.4 - 2/3/2018 - Ulises Jeremias Cornejo Fandos <mailto:ulisescf.24@gmail.com>

After a long time, it is decided to continue recording the growth of the library through this document. Between the last record and the current state of the library, it has suffered a lot of changes.

V1.0 represents a turning point in the development of the library. From now on it is expected to be able to document in detail each of the changes made.

#### Routines available in CML

The library covers a wide range of topics in numerical computing.
Routines are available for the following areas,

-   Mathematical Functions
-   Complex Numbers
-   Special Functions
-   Quaternions
-   Differential Equations
-   Numerical Differentiation
-   IEEE Floating-Point
-   Physical Constants
-   Easing Functions
-   Statistics
-   Blocks
-   Vector _(Valarrays)_ and Matrices
-   Sorting Methods
-   One Dimensional Root-Finding

## 1.0 - 19/7/2017

It is uploaded to the master branch of the repository cml the new reimplementation of the library, which takes a new approach, changing and improving each of the proportional mathematical definitions. It restarts the previous version, quickly reaching version 1.0.

# Discontinued version change Log

## 1.0 - 4/3/2017

This version means a complete re-implementation of the library. From this moment we take into account something very important for the development of cml: C is not an object-oriented programming language and should never be.

## 0.3 - 3/30/2017

### Added

-   new types added
-   mathematical fields definition

### Changed

-   filesystem changes
-   object-oriented programming in the development of algebraic structures
-   eulerian trigonometry definitions
-   restructuring of library configuration structures

### Fixed

-   minimum errors in function resolution performance
-   errors in Eulerian trigonometry functions definition
