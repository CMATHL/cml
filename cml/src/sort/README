    CML Sorting Algorithms

This chapter describes functions for sorting data, both directly and
indirectly (using an index).

All the functions use the heapsort algorithm.
============================================

Heapsort is an O(N log(N)) algorithm which operates in-place and does not
require any additional storage. It also provides consistent performance,
the running time for its worst-case (ordered data) being not significantly
longer than the average and best cases.

NOTE: the heapsort algorithm does not preserve the relative ordering
of equal elementsâ€”it is an unstable sort. However the resulting order
of equal elements will be consistent across different platforms
when using these functions.


Why not having an additional algorithm?
=======================================

CML provides a slightly more complete alternative to the standard library
function qsort(). This qsort routine was taken from Bentley & McIlroy's
"Engineering a Sort Function" and modified by Ulises Jeremias Cornejo Fandos
to store the permutation vector resulting from the sorting and to
sort array with non contiguous cells, typically a column of matrix
sorted row-wise.
