/*  The qsort function sorts an array of nmemb objects, the initial element of
    which is pointed to by base.  The size of each object is specified by size.

    The contents of the array are sorted into ascending order according to a
    comparison function pointed to by compar, which is called with two
    arguments that point to the objects being compared. The function shall
    return an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if the first
    argument is considered to be respectively less than, equal to, or greater
    than the second.

    If two elements compare as equal, their order in the resulting sorted array
    is unspecified.
