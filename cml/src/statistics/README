    CML Statistics

This is the basic statistics library of cml. It provides statistical
operations available for each of the standard data types of the C language.
In the source folder there are the specific algorithms for each of
the operations. Some of these algorithms were inspired by readings mentioned
in the corresponding documentation as well as in similar projects such as
GSL (GNU Scientific Library) and the IMSL Fortran Numerical Library,
among others.
